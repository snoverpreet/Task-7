**Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions**

**1. Open Your Browser’s Extension/Add-ons Manager**
Brave:
-Click the three horizontal lines (☰) in the top-right corner.
-Click Extensions in the left menu.

**2. Review All Installed Extensions Carefully**
Go through the list one by one:
-Do you recognize it? If you don’t remember installing it, that’s a red flag.

-Do you still use it? Old or unused extensions are often forgotten but still have permissions.

**3. Check Permissions and Reviews**
Permissions: If an extension asks for unnecessary access (e.g., "Read and change all your data on all websites"), be cautious.

Reviews & Ratings: In the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons site, check what other users say.

Developer Info: Unknown developers with no clear company name could be suspicious.

**4. Identify Unused or Suspicious Extensions**
Look out for:

-Extensions with random names or typos.

-Extensions with no official source or outdated versions.

-Extensions that suddenly appeared without your knowledge.

**5. Remove Suspicious or Unnecessary Extensions**
click Remove on the suspicious extension.

**6. Restart Browser & Check for Performance**
Close all browser windows, reopen, and see if speed or stability improves.

=Track browsing history and steal personal data.
=Insert ads or redirect search results.
=Log keystrokes (including passwords).
=Spread malware to other devices.

**8. For your deliverable:
None of the extensions were suspicious so no need to remove any till date
